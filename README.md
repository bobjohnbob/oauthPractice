# oauthPractice

A simple library and example page to demonstrate implicit oauth authoriztion.  I will probably add other oauth authorization strategies soon each as a separate file in the repository.  You probably shouldn't actually use this library in production, as I haven't spent time testing it and have only used it as an example application and to refresh myself on the different oath strategies.
