# oauthPractice

A simple library and example page to demonstrate implicit oauth authorization.
I may add other authorization strategies at some point, but I'm still figuring
out the easiest way to make the server-side stuff work.  Please don't use this
library in production.  I haven't spent time testing it and have only used it
as an example application and to refresh myself on the different oath
strategies.
